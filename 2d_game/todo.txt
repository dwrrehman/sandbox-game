todo:
-----------

	- add sonar/raycasing  thingy    for determining which cells we can see, 
		make it time dependent- the longer you sit there themore you can see,
			but when you move, you have to recalibrate or something kinda

				sonar prefrably 




	- make it so we can place blocks, based on how much    material   we have 

			make it so breaking blocks gathers material, 

				and make it so that you have to hold down place longer for a stronger block. 


	- add liquids!	with the right physics and stuff!


	- should we make this a top down game? like terraria kinda?


			ie, introduce gravity!    then movement gets more complex... the game becomes 1d basically lol. hmmmm



	- make it mulitplyer next! thats the next big task. 

	- just work on making the server client connection relaible/low latency, and have good properties. not like minecrafts connection lol 


	- add some sort of terrain genreation!   


	- add some sort of redstone like thing!  ie circuits! 

		allow wires to cross too lol. prety important.




	- add health!

	= make the npc's  intelligent! just like players. place blocks, interact with the world, etc. they are just like players actually. 



	- make them look the same too, with a slight difference maybe. ..idk
