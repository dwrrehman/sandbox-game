todo for terminal based 3d game:
==================================


	- get basic 3d rendering working     no libraries

	- blend the colors for a character that has 8 pixels all with different colors.
	- however, if they are all the same color, then keep the color. 
	- don't blend with black?... or maybe do, idk.. hmmm

	- start with a very low resolution    at the beginning, do it based on screen size plz



	- figure out how to use the mouse with it maybe? idk... probably not actually nvm


	- use sparse voxels, i think. yay.
