# Universe Sandbox Game.
#### Made by Daniel Warren Riaz Rehman.

a 3D multiplayer universe sandbox game, focused on dynamic complex game mechanics, and minimalism in mechanics design.

the idea for the game is that the player finds themselves in a universe, full of particles, and the player themselves is also made up of particles. the players view consists entirely based on what photons in the universe hit is retina, and thus, ray casting is essentially done serverside, by running the universe. complex interactions between particles consistute the entire game mechanics, ie, just the laws of physics of the universe.

the player has no inventory. they must figure out how to carry what they want to transport. 
the player has no health, although can die, from a particle hitting their body and causing it to break in some way. 
there are no mobs, however particles can assemble into structures that could hurt the player. hostile life is rare, but could happen.
the player is not a seperate thing- they are entire made up of the universe themselves. they possess motors/muscles to move, and a retina to see. and possibly even something like ears, to listen. all made up of particles, which relay information to the client, when hit with something.

the game is currently under development, and somewhat crucially relies on finding the "universe algorithm" in order to actually run a real universe serverside, which has not been found yet. however, i am still developing the rest of the infrastructure needed to make the game work, sans the universe itself. 

hope you like it!
